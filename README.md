## üìê Mathematical Background

Given a linear system:

$$Ax=b$$

the goal is to compute the unknown vector $x$ using an efficient and numerically stable method.
One of the most common techniques is LU decomposition, which expresses the matrix $A$ as the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$:

$$A=LU$$
